There's still me. I know I've been naughty, not revealing my identity, but then, maybe you've guessed; and who am I 
to deprive you of the satisfaction of working it out for yourself? Who am I, indeed?

Yes, I was there, all the time. Well, more or less all the time. I watched, I listened, I thought and sensed and 
waited, and did as I was told ( or asked, to maintain the proprieties ). I was there all right, in person or in the 
shape of one of my representatives, my little spies. 

To be honest, I don't know whether I'd have liked old Gurgeh to have found out the truth or not; still
undecided on that one, I must confess. I -we- left it to chance, in the end.
